The Caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar, who, according to Suetonius, used it with a shift of three (A becoming D when encrypting, 
and D becoming A when decrypting) to protect messages of military significance. While Caesar's was the first recorded use of this scheme, 
other substitution ciphers are known to have been used earlier.[4][5]

    	"If he had anything confidential to say, he wrote it in cipher, that is, by so changing the order of the letters of the alphabet, that 
	not a word could be made out. If anyone wishes to decipher these, and get at their meaning, he must substitute the fourth 
	letter of the alphabet, namely D, for A, and so with the others."
